# Team Contract

## Communication

1. **Team Meetings** :
We will hold weekly or biweekly in-person meetings to discuss intersecting problems, progress and work distribution. If we find that we don't have the time for in-person meetups, we will hold voice calls on Discord instead.

2. **Assistance**:
We have a Discord group set up; enough of us are sufficiently chronically online that we should be able to respond to each others' problems in a short time span, likely within 48 hours at most.

3. **Respect**:
~~Abuse Discord pings until someone responds.~~ In seriousness, all discussions on Discord are open and easily readable, so everyone is equally heard given that everyone reads through all chats. If urgent attention is required, members are encouraged to abuse Discord pings until someone responds.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Afnan has expressed interest in processing and preparing the datasets for the project. Generally, tasks will be split in roughly equal portions based on priorities of what has to be done. If multiple algorithms can be done at the same time, then we may assign an algorithm to each member. Otherwise we would have to figure out how to split the implementation of parts of an algorithm to each member. We would agree to use different C++ files to avoid git merge hell, and possibly use branches.

5. **Time Commitment** 
Likely about 2 - 6 hours a week. This will be more known when the project gets started, and as we progress further. If certain members find they do not have the time to complete their tasks, we would try to rebalance the work distribution accordingly.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
Disagreements can hopfully be resolved during discussions at meetings or on text via Discord. Problems that rhyme with "we have no idea what to do next" would likely be the kind we email our mentor (Prof. Brad Solomon) for.
